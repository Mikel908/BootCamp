# Revaluate And Their Use of Artificial Intelligence in Real Estate

## Overview and Origin

The subject of this case study is Revaluate, and the use of artificial intelligence in the real estate market. Revaluate is a company that uses artificial intelligence to increase real estate agent lead convergence rate. It was founded in 2014 by CEO Chris Drayer and CTO Tim Segraves, and launched the first version of its product in November of 2016. Revaluate is the result of its founders' desire to "leverage technology and data, and they both liked the idea of building products that could help people in a profound way – impacting lives for the better." With the company's goal in place, the team was awarded a grant and mentorship from the Kauffman Foundation. This led to Revaluate to be invited to participate in the Boomtown Accelerator. Revaluate also launched a successful campaign on Crunchbase, a crowdsourcing investment platform.

## Business Activities:

Revaluate is a software and API that uses artificial intelligence to determine, which among a real estate agent's contacts will be most likely to move within the next three to six months. By providing this targeted group of clients to concentrate on, Revaluate allows the real estate agent to save time and money. This can increase the agent's efficiency and allow them to spend more time on other real estate tasks. Not only is this platform good for real estate agents and brokers, it is also helpful for banks, lenders and loan officers, looking to predict when clients may need their services next. Revaluate uses a predictive algorithm that draws publicly available and user input data to evaluate the clients.

## Landscape:

Revaluate operates in the real estate domain of the financial industry, but it can also be used in the mortgage/lending domain, as well. The FinTech major trends and innovations in this domain have been the use of publicly available information to feed artificial intelligence systems, to better predict buyers, sellers, loan eligibility, as well as the automation of nurturing and following up with clients. There are a growing number of competitors in this space, with various degrees of overlap. These companies include Marketplace, Offrs, kvcore and Chime.

## Results

Thus far, Revaluate's impact on the real estate market is difficult to gauge. They are a private company, with no publicly avaiable financial data. They do run a private, Revaluate User's Success Story Facebook Group, which I haven't been able to gain approval to. Revaluate has also been able to gain key partnerships for API integration, including MS Office 365, Google and Salesforce. While financial data is scarce, Revaluate has published its performance data. Performance in this domain is measured by the comparison of suggested client transaction conversion rate. Revaluate delivers a 19% prediction rate compared to a conversion rate for online real estate leads that usually hovers between a reported 2-3%, however, The National Association of Realtors® have disclosed that the rate is actually lower and closer to 0.4% – 1.2%.

## Recommendations

Revaluate offers an industry leading prediction platform. While the product offers predictions on who in your contacts will move within 3-6 months, I would suggest they add the ability to rank the remaining clients in your client management resource by their likelihood of moving in a later window. I make this suggestion because it would allow real estate agents the opportunity to nurture clients who may consider moving in the near future. This additional feature would not require any additional technologies to deploy, making it cost effective and fast to implement.
